# Dicejack
Dicejack is an interactive game of dice created to test my Java skills.

The user needs to pick three numbers.

The user needs to roll the dice three times.

The user wins if:
    The sum of dice rolls is smaller than the sum of numbers choosen.
    The difference between the numbers is less than three.
